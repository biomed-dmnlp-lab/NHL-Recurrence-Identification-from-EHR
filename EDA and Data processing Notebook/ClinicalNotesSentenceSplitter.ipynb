       "   \"***** **** Health System Patient Instructions  Cholecystectomy: Before Your Surgery  What is cholecystectomy?  Cholecystectomy (**-***-***-***-***-***) is surgery to remove the gallbladder and gallstones. It is usually done as a laparoscopic surgery. Some people call this Band-aid surgery because it requires only small cuts (incisions). To do this type of surgery, a doctor puts a lighted tube, or scope, and other surgical tools through the small incisions in your belly. The doctor is able to see your organs with the scope. After your gallbladder is removed, you will no longer have gallstones. The incisions leave scars that usually fade with time.  Most people go home the day of surgery. You probably will feel better each day. Most people have only a small amount of pain after 1 week. If you have a desk-type job, you will probably be able to return to work or your normal routine in 1 to 2 weeks. If you lift heavy objects or have a very active job, such as being a carpenter or doing outdoor work, it may take up to 4 weeks.  Either before or during surgery, your doctor may choose to do an open surgery instead. In this type of surgery, your doctor will make a larger cut in your upper belly. You will probably stay in the hospital for 2 to 4 days, and it may take 4 to 6 weeks before you get back to your normal routine.  Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.  What happens before surgery?  Having surgery can be stressful. This information will help you understand what you can expect and how to safely prepare for surgery.  Preparing for surgery  · Bring a list of questions to ask your doctors. It is important that you understand exactly what surgery is planned, the risks, benefits, and other options before your surgery.  · Tell your doctors ALL the medicines, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies you take. Some of these can increase the risk of bleeding or interact with anesthesia. Your doctor will tell you which medicines to take or stop before your surgery.  · If you take blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel (Plavix), or aspirin, be sure to talk to your doctor. He or she will tell you if you should stop taking these medicines before your surgery. Make sure that you understand exactly what your doctor wants you to do.  · You may need to stop taking certain medicines a week or more before surgery, so talk to your doctor as soon as you can.  · Before your surgery, you will speak with an anesthesia provider to discuss your anesthetic options, including the risks, benefits, and alternatives to each. This may be on the phone or in person.  · You may need to empty your colon with an enema or laxative. Your doctor will tell you how to do this.  Taking care of yourself before surgery  · Build healthy habits into your life. Changes are best made several weeks before surgery, since your body may react to sudden changes in your habits.  ¨ Stay as active as you can.  ¨ Eat a healthy diet.  ¨ Cut back or quit alcohol and tobacco.  · If you have an advance directive-which may include a living will and a durable power of attorney for health care-let your doctor know. If you do not have one, you may want to prepare one so your doctor and loved ones know your health care wishes. Doctors recommend that everyone prepare these papers before surgery, regardless of the type of surgery or condition.  What happens on the day of surgery?  · Follow the instructions exactly about when to stop eating and drinking, or your surgery may be canceled. If your doctor has instructed you to take your medicines on the day of surgery, please do so using only a sip of water.  · Take a bath or shower before you come in for your surgery. Do not apply lotions, perfumes, deodorants, or nail polish.  · Do NOT shave the surgical site yourself.  · Remove all jewelry, piercings, and contact lenses.  · Leave your valuables at home.  At the hospital or surgery center  · Bring a picture ID.  · Before surgery you will be asked to repeat your full name, what surgery you are having, and what part of your body is being operated on. The area for surgery may be marked.  · A small tube (IV) will be placed in a vein, to give you fluids and medicine to help you relax. Because of the combination of medicines given to keep you comfortable, you may not remember much about the operating room.  · You will be kept comfortable and safe by your anesthesia provider. The anesthesia may range from making you fully asleep, to simply numbing the area being worked on. This will depend on the procedure you are having, as well as a discussion between your doctor, the anesthesia provider, and you.  · The surgery usually takes 1 to 2 hours.  · As you wake up in the recovery room, the nurse will check to be sure you are stable and comfortable. It is important for you to tell your doctor and nurse how you feel and ask questions about any concerns you may have.  Going home  · Be sure you have someone to drive you home.  · For your safety, you should not drive until you are no longer taking pain medicines and you can move and react easily.  · Arrange for extra help at home after surgery, especially if you live alone or provide care for another person.  · You will be given more specific instructions about recovering from your surgery, including activity and when you may return to work.  When should you call your doctor?  · You have questions or concerns.  · You don't understand how to prepare for your surgery.  · You become ill before the surgery (such as fever, flu, or a cold).  · You need to reschedule or have changed your mind about having the surgery.

       "   '***** **** Health System Patient Instructions  Deep Vein Thrombosis: After Your Visit  Your Care Instructions  A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot in certain veins of the legs, pelvis, or arms. Blood clots in these veins need to be treated because they can get bigger, break loose, and travel through the bloodstream to the lungs. A blood clot in a lung can be life-threatening.  You will need to take blood thinners for 3 to 6 months or longer. Blood thinners help prevent new blood clots from forming. Blood thinners will not get rid of a blood clot you already have, but they will keep the clot from getting bigger. Your body will get rid of most or all of the blood clot you already have over time. It is important for you to go to follow-up visits so your doctor can see if your medicine is working.  Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It__s also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.  How can you care for yourself at home?  · Take your medicines exactly as prescribed. Call your doctor if you think you are having a problem with your medicine.  · You may have blood tests--sometimes every day at first--and every 2 to 4 weeks later on to see how well the medicine is working.  · Wear compression stockings if your doctor recommends them. These stockings are tighter at the feet than on the legs. They can reduce pain and swelling and may keep blood from pooling in your legs. You can get them with a prescription at a medical supply store or at some drugstores.  · Do not suddenly change your intake of vitamin K-rich foods, such as broccoli, cabbage, asparagus, lettuce, and spinach. This will help blood thinners work evenly from day to day.  · Do not take any over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements that contain vitamin K unless your doctor says it is okay.  · Limit alcohol to 2 drinks a day for men and 1 drink a day for women. *** much alcohol can cause health problems.  · Raise your leg or arm on a pillow when sitting. Try to keep it above the level of your heart.  · Use a heating pad for 20 to 30 minutes 3 or 4 times a day to reduce pain and swelling. Put a thin cloth between the heating pad and your skin.  · Do gentle exercise, such as walking, to help prevent future clots. Avoid contact sports and other activities that might make you ****. If you are injured, apply pressure to stop bleeding.  · Wear medical alert jewelry that says you take blood thinners. You can buy this at most drugstores.  When should you call for help?  Call 911 anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example, call if:  · You have sudden chest pain and shortness of breath, or you cough up blood.  · You vomit blood or what looks like coffee grounds.  · You pass maroon or very bloody stools.  · You passed out (lost consciousness).  Call your doctor now or seek immediate medical care if:  · You have new or increased shortness of breath.  · You are dizzy or lightheaded, or you feel like you may faint.  · You have signs of another blood clot, such as:  ¨ New pain in your calf, back of the knee, thigh, or groin.  ¨ New redness and swelling in your leg or groin.  · You have new bruises or blood spots under your skin.  · You have a nosebleed.  · Your gums bleed when you brush your teeth.  · You have blood in your urine.  · Your stools are black and tarlike or have streaks of blood.  · You have vaginal bleeding when you are not having your period, or heavy period bleeding.  Watch closely for changes in your health, and be sure to contact your doctor if you have any problems.   Where can you learn more?

The tubes swell and produce mucus, or phlegm. The mucus and inflamed bronchial tubes make you cough. You may have trouble breathing.  Most cases of bronchitis are caused by viruses like those that cause colds. Antibiotics may help cure bronchitis that is caused by bacteria, but not bronchitis that is caused by a virus.  Bronchitis usually develops rapidly and lasts about 2 to 3 weeks in otherwise healthy people.  Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It__s also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.  How can you care for yourself at home?  · Take all medicines exactly as prescribed.  · If your doctor prescribed antibiotics, take them as directed. Do not stop taking them just because you feel better. You need to take the full course of antibiotics.  · Get some extra rest.  · Take an over-the-counter pain medicine, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve) to reduce fever and relieve body aches. Read and follow all instructions on the label.  · Do not take two or more pain medicines at the same time unless the doctor told you to. Many pain medicines have acetaminophen, which is Tylenol. *** much acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be harmful.  · Take an over-the-counter cough medicine that contains dextromethorphan to help quiet a dry, hacking cough so that you can sleep. Avoid cough medicines that have more than one active ingredient. Read and follow all instructions on the label.  · Breathe moist air from a humidifier, hot shower, or sink filled with hot water. The heat and moisture will thin mucus so you can cough it out.  · Do not smoke. Smoking can make bronchitis worse. If you need help quitting, talk to your doctor about stop-smoking programs and medicines. These can increase your chances of quitting for good.  When should you call for help?  Call 911 anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example, call if:  · You have severe trouble breathing.  Call your doctor now or seek immediate medical care if:  · You have new or worse trouble breathing.  · You cough up dark brown or bloody mucus (sputum).  · You have a new or higher fever.  · You have a new rash.  Watch closely for changes in your health, and be sure to contact your doctor if:  · You cough more deeply or more often, especially if you notice more mucus or a change in the color of your mucus.  · You are not getting better as expected.

       "   '***** **** Health System Patient Instructions  Bronchitis: After Your Visit  Your Care Instructions  Bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchial tubes, which carry air to the lungs. The tubes swell and produce mucus, or phlegm. The mucus and inflamed bronchial tubes make you cough. You may have trouble breathing.  Most cases of bronchitis are caused by viruses like those that cause colds. Antibiotics may help cure bronchitis that is caused by bacteria, but not bronchitis that is caused by a virus.  Bronchitis usually develops rapidly and lasts about 2 to 3 weeks in otherwise healthy people.  Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It__s also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.  How can you care for yourself at home?  · Take all medicines exactly as prescribed.  · If your doctor prescribed antibiotics, take them as directed. Do not stop taking them just because you feel better. You need to take the full course of antibiotics.  · Get some extra rest.  · Take an over-the-counter pain medicine, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve) to reduce fever and relieve body aches. Read and follow all instructions on the label.  · Do not take two or more pain medicines at the same time unless the doctor told you to. Many pain medicines have acetaminophen, which is Tylenol. *** much acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be harmful.  · Take an over-the-counter cough medicine that contains dextromethorphan to help quiet a dry, hacking cough so that you can sleep. Avoid cough medicines that have more than one active ingredient. Read and follow all instructions on the label.  · Breathe moist air from a humidifier, hot shower, or sink filled with hot water. The heat and moisture will thin mucus so you can cough it out.  · Do not smoke. Smoking can make bronchitis worse. If you need help quitting, talk to your doctor about stop-smoking programs and medicines. These can increase your chances of quitting for good.  When should you call for help?  Call 911 anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example, call if:  · You have severe trouble breathing.  Call your doctor now or seek immediate medical care if:  · You have new or worse trouble breathing.  · You cough up dark brown or bloody mucus (sputum).  · You have a new or higher fever.  · You have a new rash.  Watch closely for changes in your health, and be sure to contact your doctor if:  · You cough more deeply or more often, especially if you notice more mucus or a change in the color of your mucus.  · You are not getting better as expected.

       "   \"***** **** Health System Patient Instructions  Cholecystectomy: Before Your Surgery  What is cholecystectomy?  Cholecystectomy (**-***-***-***-***-***) is surgery to remove the gallbladder and gallstones. It is usually done as a laparoscopic surgery. Some people call this Band-aid surgery because it requires only small cuts (incisions). To do this type of surgery, a doctor puts a lighted tube, or scope, and other surgical tools through the small incisions in your belly. The doctor is able to see your organs with the scope. After your gallbladder is removed, you will no longer have gallstones. The incisions leave scars that usually fade with time.  Most people go home the day of surgery. You probably will feel better each day. Most people have only a small amount of pain after 1 week. If you have a desk-type job, you will probably be able to return to work or your normal routine in 1 to 2 weeks. If you lift heavy objects or have a very active job, such as being a carpenter or doing outdoor work, it may take up to 4 weeks.  Either before or during surgery, your doctor may choose to do an open surgery instead. In this type of surgery, your doctor will make a larger cut in your upper belly. You will probably stay in the hospital for 2 to 4 days, and it may take 4 to 6 weeks before you get back to your normal routine.  Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.  What happens before surgery?  Having surgery can be stressful. This information will help you understand what you can expect and how to safely prepare for surgery.  Preparing for surgery  · Bring a list of questions to ask your doctors. It is important that you understand exactly what surgery is planned, the risks, benefits, and other options before your surgery.  · Tell your doctors ALL the medicines, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies you take. Some of these can increase the risk of bleeding or interact with anesthesia. Your doctor will tell you which medicines to take or stop before your surgery.  · If you take blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel (Plavix), or aspirin, be sure to talk to your doctor. He or she will tell you if you should stop taking these medicines before your surgery. Make sure that you understand exactly what your doctor wants you to do.  · You may need to stop taking certain medicines a week or more before surgery, so talk to your doctor as soon as you can.  · Before your surgery, you will speak with an anesthesia provider to discuss your anesthetic options, including the risks, benefits, and alternatives to each. This may be on the phone or in person.  · You may need to empty your colon with an enema or laxative. Your doctor will tell you how to do this.  Taking care of yourself before surgery  · Build healthy habits into your life. Changes are best made several weeks before surgery, since your body may react to sudden changes in your habits.  ¨ Stay as active as you can.  ¨ Eat a healthy diet.  ¨ Cut back or quit alcohol and tobacco.  · If you have an advance directive-which may include a living will and a durable power of attorney for health care-let your doctor know. If you do not have one, you may want to prepare one so your doctor and loved ones know your health care wishes. Doctors recommend that everyone prepare these papers before surgery, regardless of the type of surgery or condition.  What happens on the day of surgery?  · Follow the instructions exactly about when to stop eating and drinking, or your surgery may be canceled. If your doctor has instructed you to take your medicines on the day of surgery, please do so using only a sip of water.  · Take a bath or shower before you come in for your surgery. Do not apply lotions, perfumes, deodorants, or nail polish.  · Do NOT shave the surgical site yourself.  · Remove all jewelry, piercings, and contact lenses.  · Leave your valuables at home.  At the hospital or surgery center  · Bring a picture ID.  · Before surgery you will be asked to repeat your full name, what surgery you are having, and what part of your body is being operated on. The area for surgery may be marked.  · A small tube (IV) will be placed in a vein, to give you fluids and medicine to help you relax. Because of the combination of medicines given to keep you comfortable, you may not remember much about the operating room.  · You will be kept comfortable and safe by your anesthesia provider. The anesthesia may range from making you fully asleep, to simply numbing the area being worked on. This will depend on the procedure you are having, as well as a discussion between your doctor, the anesthesia provider, and you.  · The surgery usually takes 1 to 2 hours.  · As you wake up in the recovery room, the nurse will check to be sure you are stable and comfortable. It is important for you to tell your doctor and nurse how you feel and ask questions about any concerns you may have.  Going home  · Be sure you have someone to drive you home.  · For your safety, you should not drive until you are no longer taking pain medicines and you can move and react easily.  · Arrange for extra help at home after surgery, especially if you live alone or provide care for another person.  · You will be given more specific instructions about recovering from your surgery, including activity and when you may return to work.  When should you call your doctor?  · You have questions or concerns.  · You don't understand how to prepare for your surgery.  · You become ill before the surgery (such as fever, flu, or a cold).  · You need to reschedule or have changed your mind about having the surgery.

       "   '***** **** Health System Patient Instructions  Deep Vein Thrombosis: After Your Visit  Your Care Instructions  A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot in certain veins of the legs, pelvis, or arms. Blood clots in these veins need to be treated because they can get bigger, break loose, and travel through the bloodstream to the lungs. A blood clot in a lung can be life-threatening.  You will need to take blood thinners for 3 to 6 months or longer. Blood thinners help prevent new blood clots from forming. Blood thinners will not get rid of a blood clot you already have, but they will keep the clot from getting bigger. Your body will get rid of most or all of the blood clot you already have over time. It is important for you to go to follow-up visits so your doctor can see if your medicine is working.  Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It__s also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.  How can you care for yourself at home?  · Take your medicines exactly as prescribed. Call your doctor if you think you are having a problem with your medicine.  · You may have blood tests--sometimes every day at first--and every 2 to 4 weeks later on to see how well the medicine is working.  · Wear compression stockings if your doctor recommends them. These stockings are tighter at the feet than on the legs. They can reduce pain and swelling and may keep blood from pooling in your legs. You can get them with a prescription at a medical supply store or at some drugstores.  · Do not suddenly change your intake of vitamin K-rich foods, such as broccoli, cabbage, asparagus, lettuce, and spinach. This will help blood thinners work evenly from day to day.  · Do not take any over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements that contain vitamin K unless your doctor says it is okay.  · Limit alcohol to 2 drinks a day for men and 1 drink a day for women. *** much alcohol can cause health problems.  · Raise your leg or arm on a pillow when sitting. Try to keep it above the level of your heart.  · Use a heating pad for 20 to 30 minutes 3 or 4 times a day to reduce pain and swelling. Put a thin cloth between the heating pad and your skin.  · Do gentle exercise, such as walking, to help prevent future clots. Avoid contact sports and other activities that might make you ****. If you are injured, apply pressure to stop bleeding.  · Wear medical alert jewelry that says you take blood thinners. You can buy this at most drugstores.  When should you call for help?  Call 911 anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example, call if:  · You have sudden chest pain and shortness of breath, or you cough up blood.  · You vomit blood or what looks like coffee grounds.  · You pass maroon or very bloody stools.  · You passed out (lost consciousness).  Call your doctor now or seek immediate medical care if:  · You have new or increased shortness of breath.  · You are dizzy or lightheaded, or you feel like you may faint.  · You have signs of another blood clot, such as:  ¨ New pain in your calf, back of the knee, thigh, or groin.  ¨ New redness and swelling in your leg or groin.  · You have new bruises or blood spots under your skin.  · You have a nosebleed.  · Your gums bleed when you brush your teeth.  · You have blood in your urine.  · Your stools are black and tarlike or have streaks of blood.  · You have vaginal bleeding when you are not having your period, or heavy period bleeding.  Watch closely for changes in your health, and be sure to contact your doctor if you have any problems.   Where can you learn more?

The tubes swell and produce mucus, or phlegm. The mucus and inflamed bronchial tubes make you cough. You may have trouble breathing.  Most cases of bronchitis are caused by viruses like those that cause colds. Antibiotics may help cure bronchitis that is caused by bacteria, but not bronchitis that is caused by a virus.  Bronchitis usually develops rapidly and lasts about 2 to 3 weeks in otherwise healthy people.  Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It__s also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.  How can you care for yourself at home?  · Take all medicines exactly as prescribed.  · If your doctor prescribed antibiotics, take them as directed. Do not stop taking them just because you feel better. You need to take the full course of antibiotics.  · Get some extra rest.  · Take an over-the-counter pain medicine, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve) to reduce fever and relieve body aches. Read and follow all instructions on the label.  · Do not take two or more pain medicines at the same time unless the doctor told you to. Many pain medicines have acetaminophen, which is Tylenol. *** much acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be harmful.  · Take an over-the-counter cough medicine that contains dextromethorphan to help quiet a dry, hacking cough so that you can sleep. Avoid cough medicines that have more than one active ingredient. Read and follow all instructions on the label.  · Breathe moist air from a humidifier, hot shower, or sink filled with hot water. The heat and moisture will thin mucus so you can cough it out.  · Do not smoke. Smoking can make bronchitis worse. If you need help quitting, talk to your doctor about stop-smoking programs and medicines. These can increase your chances of quitting for good.  When should you call for help?  Call 911 anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example, call if:  · You have severe trouble breathing.  Call your doctor now or seek immediate medical care if:  · You have new or worse trouble breathing.  · You cough up dark brown or bloody mucus (sputum).  · You have a new or higher fever.  · You have a new rash.  Watch closely for changes in your health, and be sure to contact your doctor if:  · You cough more deeply or more often, especially if you notice more mucus or a change in the color of your mucus.  · You are not getting better as expected.

       "   '***** **** Health System Patient Instructions  Bronchitis: After Your Visit  Your Care Instructions  Bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchial tubes, which carry air to the lungs. The tubes swell and produce mucus, or phlegm. The mucus and inflamed bronchial tubes make you cough. You may have trouble breathing.  Most cases of bronchitis are caused by viruses like those that cause colds. Antibiotics may help cure bronchitis that is caused by bacteria, but not bronchitis that is caused by a virus.  Bronchitis usually develops rapidly and lasts about 2 to 3 weeks in otherwise healthy people.  Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It__s also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.  How can you care for yourself at home?  · Take all medicines exactly as prescribed.  · If your doctor prescribed antibiotics, take them as directed. Do not stop taking them just because you feel better. You need to take the full course of antibiotics.  · Get some extra rest.  · Take an over-the-counter pain medicine, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve) to reduce fever and relieve body aches. Read and follow all instructions on the label.  · Do not take two or more pain medicines at the same time unless the doctor told you to. Many pain medicines have acetaminophen, which is Tylenol. *** much acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be harmful.  · Take an over-the-counter cough medicine that contains dextromethorphan to help quiet a dry, hacking cough so that you can sleep. Avoid cough medicines that have more than one active ingredient. Read and follow all instructions on the label.  · Breathe moist air from a humidifier, hot shower, or sink filled with hot water. The heat and moisture will thin mucus so you can cough it out.  · Do not smoke. Smoking can make bronchitis worse. If you need help quitting, talk to your doctor about stop-smoking programs and medicines. These can increase your chances of quitting for good.  When should you call for help?  Call 911 anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example, call if:  · You have severe trouble breathing.  Call your doctor now or seek immediate medical care if:  · You have new or worse trouble breathing.  · You cough up dark brown or bloody mucus (sputum).  · You have a new or higher fever.  · You have a new rash.  Watch closely for changes in your health, and be sure to contact your doctor if:  · You cough more deeply or more often, especially if you notice more mucus or a change in the color of your mucus.  · You are not getting better as expected.
