# Project: NHL recurrence identification in EHR using Machine Learning

This project experiments with tabular machine learning and LLM approach to identify recurrent cases given historic EHR data of patient.

The tool developed 

## Background



Sub-types of NHL recurrence tested on:
1. DLBCL (Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma)
2. FL (Follicular Lymphoma)

Our experiments highight RAG apporach outperform both heuristic/rule-based and tabular machine approaches
