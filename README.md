# Project: NHL recurrence identification in EHR using Machine Learning

This project experiments with tabular machine learning and LLM approach to identify recurrent cases given historic EHR data of patient.

Sub-types of NHL recurrence tested on:
1. DLBCL (Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma)
2. FL (Follicular Lymphoma)

The tool developed is intended to automate identifiation of NHL recurrent cases from EHR.

Our experiments highight RAG apporach outperform both heuristic/rule-based and tabular machine approaches
